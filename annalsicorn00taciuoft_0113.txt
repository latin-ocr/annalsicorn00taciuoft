acts? 'I'his was quite a different thing from the sacramentum in
verba &erari-s, which was an oath oi allegiance to the person ot the
Emperor, taken at the commeneement of a new reign. The present

logon muntia : Tacitus proceeds to state that trials for majestas
(or, in rull, laesa majo’stae) under the Republic were confined to
cases of maladministration in a public capacity, and crimes against
the state. Under the Empire they were extended not only to what
are called in English ποτε acts οἱ hostility, but also to speeches and
writings directed against the Emperor, the representative of the
state. Some illnstrations of the new stretch of meaning given to it

'rbere were under the Empire three courts of criminal jurisdiction,
each final, but each under the influence of the princeps. (l) The
Praetor-'⁸ Com-t, in which jurors (iudices) gave a verdict on the facts,
and the presiding praetor stated what the prescribed penalty was.
Here the princeps made out the albu-m iudicum (whence the jurors
were taken), sometimes sat in cornu tribunalis (Ch. 75), and might
give his calculus Minervae, if the jury were equally divided. (2)
The aaut& court (non-existent in Republican times since the
establishment of the praetorship in Rc. 367), with the senate as his
assessors; though this court 00qu prescribe the penalty, its exe-
cution might be prevented by the princeps’ intercessu» (cf. ΙΙΙ.
51, 3). (3) The Princeps Court, paneis familiarium αιῖὶιὶὂὶἰὶε
(ΙΙΙ. 10). This was quite a novelty, but was lit-tle used by Tiberius,
who preferredssto escape the odium of condemning. In the case of
Granius Marcellus (Ι. 74) both (l) and (2) are mentioned.
