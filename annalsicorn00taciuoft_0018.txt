Augustus and his successors, with regard to the senate,
was quite different from that of Julius Caesar. Augustus'
treated the senate with invariable deference. He kept its
numbers within due limits, He improved its status by
ejecting men of scandalous lives, and by allowing those
who were too poor to bear the expenses of their rank to
withdraw. With it rested the formal choice of an emperor 3
it decreed the honours of a triumph, and its enactments on
domestic matters were promulgated as of old. Augustus
shared with it the government of the provinces, giving it
jurisdiction over such as did not require the presence of an
armed force, and consequently the exercise of imperium‚·
and 130 these provinces men of consular and praetorian rank
went out as governors on the choice of the senate. Tiberius
even transferred to it from the comitia the election of
magistrates. It is true that in his capacity of president
he often drew up (nominavit) a list of candidates which
contained no more names than there were vacancies‚ and
so nullified their right of choice. (See Bk. 1., chs. 14, 15, 81.)

(3) The Ordo Equestris—The class next in dignit-,y to the
senators—the Equites—continued 130 flourish, although their
opp01 tunities of acting as publicani, farmers of taxes, had
been curtailed by the establishment of imperial provinces,
the revenues of which were managed by the emperor's
agents (procuratores fisci). Augustus had created new
ranks within their numbers, the wealthiest being entit‘led
equites splendidi. Several important offices (eff, the four
chief praefectures) were expressly reserved for Equites.

(4) The People.—Beneath the equites came the Plebs,
which down to the end of Augustus' reign continued to meet
in the comitia for the purpose of passing laws and electing
magistrates. Even then the Emperor's privilege of nomi-
natio and commendatio (1., 011. 15), left them little choice, and
this was totally lost on the accession of Tiberius. They seem,
however, to have lost all desire to govern. Provided that
the state distributions of corn· were on asufficiently generous
scale, and games were occasionally exhibited, they felt
contented with the existing state of affairs. Their political
programme was simple to state, if embarrassing to fulffl:
it was Panem et Circenses l
