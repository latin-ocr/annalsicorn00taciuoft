Syria with Cicilia and Judaea, Galatia, Pamphilia. ThNe
ranks were recognised‚ the first (6.9. the Germanias) being
governed by men of consular, the second (ey. Belgica.) by
men of praetorian dignity, both with the title of leyati
Auqusti propraetore, the third (6.9. Rhaetia) by a procurator
Auqusti.

(b) The senatorial provinces were Sicily, Sardinia and
Corsica, Hispania Baetica, Gallia Narbonensis, Macedonia,
Achaia, Asia, Bithynia, Cyprus, Crete and Cyrenaica,
Africa. Of these Asia and Africa, the most important,
were governed by men of consular rank, the rest by
ex—praetors, but both were styled proconsuls. To these
senators of the requisite standing were appointed by
lot: they were responsible to the senate only, not to the
emperor. At the same time they were to some extent
controlled in their administration by a procurator fisci,
appointed by the Princeps. Egypt belonged to neither of
these classes: its wealth and corn-producing capabilities
caused Augustus to plaoe it under an eques of moderate
fortune, answerable to himself, and not likely to prove
troublesome by reason of ambitious designs. The frontier
provinces were guarded by twenty-five legions (twenty-eight
in theory, but the legions lost with Varus were never re-
organised), supplemented by the vemillarii, or veterans ¹of
the reserve, the cohortes civium Romanorum, Italian volun-
teers, and the contingents of the Allies. The loyalty of
Rome was secured by the Praetorian cohorts and the cohortes
urbanae, the latter under the orders of the praefectus urbis.
Three fleets were maintained at Ravenna, Misenum, and
Forum J ulii, to guard the Hadriane, the western coast, and
the mouth of the Rhone respectively‚ and there were minor
flotillas on the frontier rivers.
