Tamfana, a German deity (Ch. 51).

Tarraconensis colonia (Τανναῃοηα), founded by Julius Caesar, the
capital of Hispania Tarraconensis. A temple was erected by the
inhabitants to Augustus in A.D. 15 (Ch. 78).

Taunus Mons, a ridge of mountains running in 3 northerly direction
through the country ot the Chatti, and not far from the Rhine.

Teutoburgiensis Saltus (Teutobur-[ser Wald), a forest-clad range of

Tiberis (Tei-ere), rises in the Apennines near Tifernum, then flows
south, forming the boundary between Etruria and Umbria, and falls
into the sea at Ostia. It receives on the right bank the Clanis, on
the left the Nar and Anio and Allia. Its overflowings frequently
did great damage to Rome (Ch. 79).

Tiberius claudius Nero (Ti. Caesar Auara-etus), born ΒΩ. 42, was
the son ot Tib. Claudius Nero and Livia. He was early employed
in important negotiations and wars. At the age of twenty-two he
was sent to make Tigranes king of Armenia, and to settle the affairs
of that distracted country. In B.c. 15 he, together with his younger
brother Drusus, was engaged in subduing Rhaetia. Two years later
he obtained the highest office in the state—the consulship. But his
honours were dearly bought by the forced abandonment of his wife
Vipsania (qm.) in B.c. ll. The new wife whom he took in her plaoe
—the Emperor’s daughter J ulia —treated him with unconeealed con-
tempt, and committed acts of shameless excess. Another misfortune
which befel him about this time was the death of his brother Drusus
while campaigning on the Rhine frontier. Tiberius, who was then
engaged in the subjection of the Delmatians and Pannonians, hurried
to Germany, but arrived only in time to close his brother’s eyes
(13.0. 9). Η8 then took the place of Drusus in the North, and cam-
paigned against the German t1ibes in B.c. 8 and the following year.
Meanwhile the profligacy of Julia was becoming more notorious
every day; the youthful princes, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, seemed
destined to succeed 10 the throne; and so Tiberius, feeling his present
mode of life unendurable, took the resolution of retiring to Rhodes,
and leaving the turmoil of public life to others. He lived there
quietly until A.D. 2, when the death of Lucius Caesar enabled him
to return to Rome. His wife had been banished by Augustus in
B.c. 2, and in A.D. 4 the death of Gaius Caesar left a gap in the
imperial family which could only be filled by his adoption. In
the same year he was recognized as the Emperor's heir by being
invested with the tribunicia potestas. In A.D. 13 he became the col· —
