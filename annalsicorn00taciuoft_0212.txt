at the same time the forces of the van got clear of the
woods‚ and pitched a camp. From this point their course
was unmolested, and confident in their recent successes, and
forgetful of the past, the soldiers were placed in winter
quarters.

anxiety ; he was glad that the mutiny was quelled, but the
fact that Germanicus had won the good-will of the soldiers
by distributing money and hastem'ng on their discharge, this,
coupled with his nephew's military renown, filled him with
