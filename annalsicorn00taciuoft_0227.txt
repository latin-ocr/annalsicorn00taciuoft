elur. 76. 49

Fathers‚ the emperor would sit on the praetor’s tribunal
at the corner, so as not to displace him flom the curule
chair‚ and many things were decided in his presence to
check bribery and the solicitations of the powerful. But

while truth was cared for, liberty was being ruined. For ,

example, Pius Aurelius, a senator, complained that his house
had been undermined, owing to the massive character of the
public road, and by an aqueduct, and called upon the senate
for assistance. When the praetors of the treasury resisted‚
Caesar came to the rescue, and paid Aurelius the price of
his house, for he liked spending money for honourable
purposes, a virtue which he long retained, though he put
off all others. To Pr0pertius Celer, a man of praetorian
standing, who asked leave to resign the senatorial rank
on the score of poverty, he gave a sum of a million sesterces,
having made quite sure that the narrowness of his resourcae
was-inherited from his father. He bade others who attempted
the same thing prove their case to the senate, harsh in
his liking for strictness, even when he acted rightly ; on

N these grounds every one else preferred silence and poverty

to avowal and relies.

obscurity things human and divine alike ς neverthekss, the
task of finding means to confine the river was entrusted to
Ateius Capito and L. Arruntius. It was determined that
Achaia and Macedonia, on complaining of their burdens,
should be relieved for the present from the proconsular ad—
ministration, and should be handed over to Caesar. Drusus
presided at the gladiatorial shows which he exhibited in
his own name and that of his brother Germanicus, for
he gloated over bloodshed‚ however common. This spread
alarm among the people‚ and his father, it was said, reproved
' him. There were various interpretations as to whysthe
>emperor absented himself from the spectacle3 some 831
it was from satiety of cmwds, others from austerity
temperament, and from sear of eomparison, as Augustu
