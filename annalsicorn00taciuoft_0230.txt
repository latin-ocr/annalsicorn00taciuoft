52 merrus, Amans 1.

about the consular elections which were held then for the
first time under this emperor, or subsequently, so utterly

conflicting are the accounts found, not only in historians, r

but also in his own speeches 3 sometimes suppressing the
names of the candidates, he described their origin, life, and
military service, so that it might be known who they were3
occasionally omitting even these hints, he urged the can-
didates not to embroil the elections by canvassing‚ and
promised his own aid in that direction3 generally he asserted
that fonly those had offered themselves as candidates, whose
names he had published to the consuls, and that others
could offer themselves if they had confidence in their influence·
or their deserts. The words were fair, but really meaning-
less and deceptive3 the greater the show of liberty by which
they were veiled, the more oppressive was the slavery in
which they were destined to result.
