and the measurements of its general's headquarters, showed

the handiwork of three legions3 a diminished remnant was
supposed to have occupied the next with its crumbling
rampart and shallow fosse. In the centre of the plain
were the whitening bones, scattered or heaped· according
as the men had fied or rallied. Hard by lay fragments of
weapons and limbs of horses, and human skulls fastened
to trunks of trees3 in the neighbouring groves were the
altars of the barbarians, at which they had sacrifioed the
tribunes and centurions of the first ranks3 and the sur-
vivors of this disaster, who had escaped from the battle
or from captivity, recalled the spots where the legates fell3
where the eagles were seized3 where Varus was first stricken
with a wound 3 where with his own hapless hand and sels-
inflicted wound he found death ; also the platform on which
Arminius harangued3 the number of gibbets for the prisonem
and the pits to bury them alive3 and how in his wanton
triumph the Cheruscan chief had scoffed at the standards
and eagles.

62. And so the Roman army that was present, six years
after the disaster, in sorrow and anger began to bury, with
passion rising against the foe, the bones of three legions,
no one knowing whether he was committing to the ground
the remains of a stranger or one of his own kith and kin ;
but regarding all as friends and kinsmen, Caesar laid the
first sod for erecting a mound, performing an act most
welcome to the· dead, and showing sympathy with those
present. This act Tiberius did not appi-ove, either because
he put an unfavourable interpretation on all the actions of
Germanicus, or because he supposed that the army was
rendered disinclined for battle by 'the sight of their slain
and unburied comrades, and more disposed to be afraid of
the enemy, and that a general invested with the augurata

and its very ancient rites ought to have shunned the
pollution of funeral ceremonies.

63. Germanicus, however, followed Arminius as he
retired into the wild country, and, as soon as ever there
was an opportunity, ordered the cavalry to gallop forth,
and gain possession of the plain occupied b he enemy.
