It is nearer the truth to say that Tiberius and Livia, the
one through sear, the other with a stepmother’s hatred,
had hastened the murder of a youth who was regarded
wit-,h suspicion and hatred. When the centurion announced,
according to military custom, that his commands had 116611
executod, Tiberius declared that he had given no such orders,
and that an account must be given 10 1116 senate. Hearing
this, Sallustius Crispus, the sharer 111 111611 5661615, 11110 had

Turranius, the former prefect of the praetorian 60110115, 1116

people followed their example. For Tiberius began every
act by means of the consuls, as if the old republic were
still in existence and he had 1101 made up his mind to
rule. Even the edict by which he summoned the senators -—
into the house was only issued by h'im under the tit-le of
the tribunician prerogative which he had received under
Augustus. Τ116 words of the proclamation were few and -ν
