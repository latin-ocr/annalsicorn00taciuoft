of chap. 5·15 is laid at Rome. The death of Agrippa
Postumpus, the plunging into slavery of consuls, senators,
knights, and people, the general flattery of Tiberius, the
honours paid to Augustus and Livia, the seeming un-
willingness of Tiberius to accept the cares of empire, are
related. Then, after mentioning the transferenoe of the
omnitia to the senate and the institution of the ludi
Auqnoetalae, the soene changes to Pannonia (chap. 16- -,30)

restore order. They are unsuccessful until an eclipse of the

though popular with the soldiers, and even invited by them
to take up arms against Tiberius, is helpless in face of the
rebellion. But when he is obliged to send away his wife
Agrippina and his little son Caligula, the soldiers feel
compunction, and show eagerness in punishing the offenders

Next year, A. D. 15, Germanicus again crosses the Rhine
to attack the Cherusci. rl'hat people is divided into two
parties, headed by Arminius and Segestes. Segestes, who
counsels friendship with Rome, is worsted in the struggle,
and takes refuge with Germanicus. The Romans penetrate
to the Amisia 3 thence they march against the Cherusci.
On their way they come on the unburied bones of Varus
