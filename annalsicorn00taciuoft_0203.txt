v peril. Accordingly, plans having been mutually considered,

it was determined that a letter should be written in the
name of the emperor ; discharge was to be granted to
those who had served twenty campaigns; those who had
served sixteen were to be released from the military oath,
and kept as reserves under a standard released from all
other duties save that of repelling the enemy, the legacies
they had asked for were to be paid and doubled.

37. The soldiers perceived that these things were invented
to meet the crisis, and at once made their demands. The
discharge was hastened on by means of the tribunes but
the attempt was made to put off payment till each reached
his winter quarters. The men of the fifth and twenty—first
legions, however, did not depart until in those very summer
quartem the sum due was collected from the private re-
souroes of Caesar and his friends, and paid in full. The
legate Caecina ffltack the first and twentieth legions to
the state of the Ubii in disgraceful order, for the money
bags of the legion which had been taken from the general
were carried among the standards and the eaglae. Ger-
manicus, setting out to the upper army, compelled the
second, thirteenth, and sixteenth legions to take the oath
without delay. The fourteenth hesitated a little; but
their pay and their discharge were presented to them,
although they did not demand it.

38. But an outbreak had been begun among the Chauci
by veterane of the disaffected legions serving on garrison
duty. These were put down for a time by the instant
execution of two soldiers. This was by the orders of
Μ’ Ennius, more as a salutat-y precedent than by any
authority granted him. Then when the sedition increased
he ran away, and having been discovered after his biding-
place had become unsafe, he borrowed a defence from audacity:
‘⁴ It is not the prefect but Germanicus your general and
Tiberius your emperor that you are outraging.'' When
those who had opposed him were at once cowed, snatching
up the standard he turned to the river-bank, and crying out
that if any one left the ranks he would be considered a
deserter, he led them back to their winter quarters, dis-
affected indeed, yet daring nothing.
