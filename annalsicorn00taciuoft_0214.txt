36 nonus, ANNALS 1.

Varus to bind himself, Arminius, and the rest of the
chiefs 3 the people, he said, would dare nothing if their
leaders were removed, and he would have time to weigh
the accusations‚ and to discriminate the innocent. But
Varus fell by fate and the arms of Arminius. Segestes,
although drawn by the national movement into the war,
yet remained at variance, his animosity being heightened on
personal grounds, because his daughter, who had been be-
trothed to another, had been carried off by Arminius, the

⁴ hated son-in-law of a father who was already his enemy 3

all the ties of love between friends became with foes incen-
tives to passion.

five thousand auxiliaries, and some hastily raised bands of
Germans dwelling on our side of the Rhine. He himself
led the same number of legions, and twice the number of
allies ; and having built a fort on the site of his father’s
ramparts on the Taunus range, hurried his army, lightly
equipped, against the Chatti, and left L. Apronius to make
roads and bridges. For, what was rare in that climate, owing
to a drought and the lowness of the rivers, he had accom-
plished a rapid march without obstruction, and he feared for
his return rains and swollen currents. But so unexpected to
the Chatti was his arrival that all whom age or sex had
rendered helpless were at once captured or massacred. ¹ The
warriors had swum across the river Adrana, and were trying
to keep back the Romans as they were commencing a bridge.
subsequently driven back by missiles and arrows, and
having vainly sought terms of peace, some fied to Germanicus,
while the rest abandoned their cantons and villages, and
wandered into the woods. Caesar, after burning Mattium,
the chief town of the tribe, and devastating the open
country, turned back to the Rhine3 and the enemy, omitting

what was his usual custom as often as he retreated for a . -

ruse rather than from alarm, did not dare to harass their
rear as they retired. It had been the intention of the
Cherusci to aid the Chatti, but Caecina kept them in alarm
by marching up and down their country, and the Marsi
who ventured to join battle he checked in a successful

engagement.
