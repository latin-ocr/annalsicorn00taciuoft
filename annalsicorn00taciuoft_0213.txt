fourteen yearS. Τ116 soldiers who were sent at this time
to execute him found him on a promontory of the shore,
expecting no glad news, On their arrival he begged for a
short respite that he might address by letter his last com-
mands to his wife Alliaria, and then offered his throat to
the assassins with a courage in death not unworthy the
Sempronian name which 1118 life had disgraced. It is

Rome but by L. Asprenas, proconsul of Africa, at the in-

still continued ; and although he was preparing with all
his strength for the summer campaign, he anticipated it at
the beginning of spring by a sudden inroad on the Chatti.
For a hope had arisen that the enemy were being divided
between Arminius and Segestes, famous respectively for
treachery and loyalty to our side. Arminius was the
disturbet of Germany 3 Segestes again and again disclosed
