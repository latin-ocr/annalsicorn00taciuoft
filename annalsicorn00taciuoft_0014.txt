passages of his writings testify to shame and regret at his
share in the servile proceedings of the senate. ,A brighter
time came with the accession of Nerva in ΑΛ). 96, and in
the succeeding year he attained the highest dignity, with
one exception, which the state could offer him, and became
the emperor's colleague in the consulship. In Aa). 100, in
conjunction with Pliny the Younger, he successfully im-
peached Marius Priscus, who had been guilty of gross
oppression during his government of Africa. This is the
last public act recorded of him. Henceforth he appears
to have lived in retirement, a devoted student of Roman
history. The date of his death is as problematical as that
,of his birth ς but he can hardly have survived for long
Trajan, who died A.D. 117, and he may have ended his days
some time previously.

ἕ 2. His Works.—The earliest of Tacitus' writings is the
Dialoyue cle Oratoribus. The plan is similar to that pursued
by Cicero in his philosophica] works. Three distinguished
orators of the day, Curiatius Maternus, Aper Secundus, and
Vipstanus Messala, meet to discuss the comparative value
of the great pleaders of the Republic and of the Empire. I't
is admitted that Cicero stands pre-eminent ς but the oratory
of later times is defended on the grounds that eloquence
g like that of Cicero can only be found amid confusion and
f anarchy, and that where order and good government prevaal,
Ι olatoi y must of necessity bear a tamer character. His
next work, the Ayricola, must have appeared in A..D 97 or
Aa). 98. The hero of this unriv alled piece of biography is
of course the famous warrior of the last decades of the first
century, who, after extending the Roman dominions in
Britain to their utmost limits (Aa). 78 to 85), returned to
Rome only to be poisoned by the command of Domitiam-2
The Germania, written about A.D. 98, is a description of the
plnysical characteristics of Germany, and of the military,
social, and politica] condition of the tribes by which it was
inhabited. Tacitus found much to praise in the purity of
their social relations, the respect paid to the marriage tie,
the kindly feeling which existed between master and slave ι
