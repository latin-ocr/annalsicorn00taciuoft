14 nenos, ANNALS 1.

But, indeed, the floggings and wounds‚ the hard wintem, the
summers passed in the labours of war, terrible campaign-
ing, or barren peace, know no end. There is no other relief
than that military life be entered on the fixed conditions‚
that om· wage be a denarius each, and that the sixteenth
year put an end to our service 3 that we be kept after that
time 110 longer under a standard, but that in the same
camp our wages be paid in cash. Do the praetorian cohorts
who receive two denarii, who after sixteen years are restored
to their hearths and homes, encounter more perils'l I do
not mean to disparage the guards of the capital ; neverthe-

emperor. I will either maintain the loyalty of the legions
alive, or, murdered, will hasten on your repentance.’'

19. None the less the turf was piled up, and had now
risen breast high, when, overcome at length by his per-
sistency, they gave up the attempt. Blaesus, a man of
considerable oratorical skill, said, “Itis not through mutiny
and tumult that the wishes of the soldiers ought to be
conveyed to Caesar, nor did the soldiers of old ask such
novel boons of ancient commanders, nor you yourselves of
the divine Augustus ; and it is little opportune that the
anxieties of the emperor, now in their beginning, should be

of peace to attempt what you did not demand even when
