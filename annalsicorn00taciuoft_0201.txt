it was believed that if he obtained power he would restore
freedom 3 from which cause the same good feeling and hope

. were displayed towards Germanicus. For he was a man

of courteous temperament aad wondrous affability, quite
a contrast to the haughtinaes and reserve which characterised
the conversation and looks of Tiberius. To this were added

former discipline, whither had they banished their tribunes
and their centurions, they all bared their bodies, and
pointed reproachfully to the scars of their wounds, and the
