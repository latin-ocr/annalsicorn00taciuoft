means that the generals he proceeds to mention—PompeiuS‚ Lepidus,

ponito triumviri nomine ε the division of authority, which Octavius,
Antonius, and Lepidus had agreed to at Bononia in ΒΩ. 43, received
shortly afterwards the assent of the comitia, and the title of triumviri
reipublicae constituendae was conferred on them for a period of five
years. In B.c. 38 they renewed the compact for a similar period,
and retained the title of trinmvirs without any special authorisation
from the people. In B.c. 33, at the end of the second term of five
years, Octavius laid down this title, though he retained the powers
it implied till B.c. 27. On the titles of Augustus and their import

mulam ιο ferent: poeinq αε consul. Octavius was elected consul
for the second time in B.c. 33, a third time in nc. 31, and then
’ continuously from that date down to B.c. 23.

nibunioio iure: the tribunicia potestas supplied the popular ele-
ment in the emperor's position. It enabled him to appear as the
protector of the populace. It rendered his person sacred (saero-

⁷ sauctus). It gave him the power of vetoing any proposal made in

the senate, and of deciding appeals involving the question of life or
death. It is doubtful whether the ius tribunicium and the potestas
tribunicia are identical. The former, assumed by Octavius in B.c. 36,
possibly only secured the inviolability of his person. The other privi-
leges of a tribune—a title he could not take to himself, being a
patrician—gradually accrued, until in B.c. 23 the emperor formally
assumed the potestas tm'lmnicia with all the powers above-mentioned.
