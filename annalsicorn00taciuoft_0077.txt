vetere . . . superbia: abl. of quality. Tacitus here follows Livy
in his estimate of the Claudia gens. The latter writer speaks of the

the very incarnation of the patriciate, and its leaders as the ‘cham-

the plebeians and che democrats.” Mommsen, however, has tried to
prove that the prevalent view is a mistakeu one. He shows that of

information, Appius the Decemvir inflicted a severe defeat on the
