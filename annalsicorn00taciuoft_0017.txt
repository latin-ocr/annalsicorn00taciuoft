⁴ 01 a tribune without the rank, for which his patrician

, birth disqualified him. Just like the tribune of the
republic, he was authorized to put his veto on any motion
made in the senate, to protect condemned persons from
the magistrates, and, if he so desired, to assemble the people
and propose laws to the comitia. This latter privilege,
however, was given him by his potestas consularis, which
also enabled him to preside in the senate, and to initiate
legislation therein-in short, to wield the legislative and
administrative powers poaeeoeed by the consuls. His
dignity of princeps &ertatem was 01 a different nature. It
conferi-ed 110 powers on him, and only made him the first
of the senators, bnt it gave him the right of declaring his

in a trial before the senate, 1110 censoria potestas gave him

(2) 'l‘he senate. —It will be evident from this review of
the emperor’s position, that the power of the senate had
imdergone a great diminution from republican 1111100. Its
military authority and its control of foreign relations were
assumed by the Emperor, and it was always liable to be over—
awed by the troops at the latter’s disposal. The policy of
