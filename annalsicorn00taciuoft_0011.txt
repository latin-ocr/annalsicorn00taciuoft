· In reading the Tm the chief object should be to arr-ive
at the meaning] with ae little help as possible, while never-
theless ensuring perfect accuracy. There will probably
occur, even in the first sentence, (a) some words which you
do not know, and (b) some difficulty in seeing the exact
construction For the first, turn to the Vocmummns3

for the second, to the Nom.1f there occur any words
which you do not know, and which do not appear in the
Vocabulary, write them neatly down, with their meaning,
in a double column upon the blank pagos left for the
purpose, adding genitive cases or principal parts, etc,

exactly as has been done’ ln the case of the printed words.

After doing your utmost to make out the passage in this
way, turn to the Tnansnmon and see how far you were
right. The Translation is not intended to save the reader
the trouble of making out the meaning, but to serve as a
test of his accuracy and to correct his errors. Beginners

’ may find such a method as this somewhat slow at first,
