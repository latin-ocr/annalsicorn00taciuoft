His next effort, the Historias, deals with a greater subject—
the history of Rome from the death of Nero to that of

the annals of any other nation. Of its fourteen books the
greater number have disappeared 3 the first four and part
of the fifth alone remain. To supplement this, he went
sarther back into the depths of antiquity, and wrote his
masterpiece the Annales. Here he traces the dostinies of [4ss
Rome under the ClaudTQ-dynasty. Tiberius, Caligula, [ἕ

point of view, and even their „gmddeeds are often distorted‚
perhaps unconsciously, by the prejudicae of the historiatas-2

executed by Tacitus: his announced intention of being the

historian of Augustus and of Nerva and Trajan being un-

5 3. His Authorities.—As Tacitus is the greatest and
almost sole authority for the history of the early Empire
Lg-for of the others, Velleius Paterculus was a vile fiatterer,
uetonius a purveyor of scandalous gossip, and Dion Cassius
too late inbpoint of time to be an independent authority—
it is important to see what sources of information were
open to him. The Empire had acted as a deterrent on
the productiori of history, but had not altogether crushed
it; and Pliny wrote his general history, while Cluvius
Rufus, Fabius Rusticus, Domitius Corbulo, and Vipstanus
Messala narrated detached periods. To all of these
Tacitus acknowledges his obligations. Whether he con-
