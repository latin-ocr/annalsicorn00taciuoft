licence to the excesses of armed bands, and the hope of
profit from civil war. In the summer camp three legions
were quartered together, under the command of Junius
Blaesus, who, hearing of the death of Augustus and the

A accession of 'Tiberius eit-her from mourning or joy had

given his men a holiday from their customary duties.
From this the soldiers began to be demomlised‚ to grow
quarrelsome‚ to lend their ears to the talk of every
‘pestilent fellow3 in a word, to desire luxury and idleness,
and to dislike discipline and toil. There was in the camp
a certain Percennius, formerly the leader of a band of

marshy swamps or mountainous wastes. For without doubt
the service itself is burdensomc and profitless ; our life and
person are valued at ten asses a day; out of this sum we
must purchase kit, arms, and tents ; from this we have to
buy off the cruelty of centurione and exemptione from duty.
