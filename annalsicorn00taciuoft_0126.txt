exception of Narbonensis (the old Provincia), were imperial provinces
governed by the legati of the Emperor.

Gallus, 1.. Asinius, the son of Asinius Pollio, won reputation as an
orator and writer. He incurred the hatred of Tiberius by marrying
his divorced wife, Vipsania. He was consul in B.c. 8, and held a
prominent place in the senate (see Ch. 8, 12, 76, 77). He was one of
the three men spoken of by Augustus as possible candidates for the
office of princeps ι the Emperor's opinion was that he was avidus et
minor (Ch. 13). In ΛΑ). 30 he was sentenced to death by the senate
at the instigation of Tiberim, and after three years' imprisonment
died of starvation.

Germania, included the country from the Rhine to the Vistula, and
from the Baltic to the Danube. The more important of the tribes
mentioned in Book Ι. are, in order from north to south, the Chauci,
Frisii, Marsi, Bructeri, Usipetes, Cherusci, and Chatti. These all
inhabited the district between the Rhine and the Albis. The Cherusci,
under the leadership of Arminius, exercised a sort of headship over
the others, and took the chief part in overthrowing Varus and iu
offering resistance to Germanicus. The name Germaniae (Superior
and Inferior) was given to two provinces on the west bank of the
Rhine, which were detached from Belgica. They were defended by
eight legions, under the command ot Germanicus. The chief town
of the upper province was Mogontiacum (Maium), of the lower Ara
Ubiorum, afterwards Colonia Agrippina (Coluqne).

Germanicus, son of the elder Drusus and Antonia, was born Rc. 15.
He was adopted by Tiberius during the life of Augustus, and assisted
him in his campaigns against the Pannonians (Aa). 7-10) and the -
Germans (A.D. 11, 12). He was in command of the Rhine frontier
when Augustus died. The mutinous soldiers offered to make him
Emperor in place of Tiberius, but he refused3 and when the rebellion
was quelled, led them against the Marsi (ΑΛ). 14), and in the subse-
quent year made his way to ihe Saltus Teutoburgiensis, where he
buried the bones of the slaughtered legions, On his way back to the
Rhine hc was attacked by Arminius and Inguiomerus, and beat off ,
the foe with difficulty. He crossed the Rhine a third time in Aa). 16,
and inflicted further defeats on Arminius. He was then recalled to
Rome, where he celebrated a triumph. Subsequently he set out for
the East to take the supreme command there. He died in Aa). 19,

Grldeelhuffi Sempronius, banished to Cercina jor an intrigue with
J ulia, whom he incited to write letters of eomplaint to Augustus about
her husband Tiberius. He was put to death in ΑΛ). 14 (Ch. 53). He

and is perhaps the tragic writer of that name mentioned by Ovid.
