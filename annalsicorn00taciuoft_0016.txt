he does not mention them by name, he probably availed
himself of their work. In addition to these there were
M emoire like those of Agrippina the Younger, not too flatter-
ing, as may be imagined, to the imperial housebfuneral
- panegyrics of eminent men, and letters similar to those
of the younger Pliny. Another mine of information might
be found in the Acta Senatu-s, a record of the proceedings
of the senate, and the Acta Populi, which related in the
barest detail the current news, and described cases in the
courts of law. Moreover, when we consider the date of
Tacitus⁷ birth, it is evident that he may have gleaned many
facts by word of mouth. It is quite possible that he was
acquainted with persons who had both seen and known
Tiberius, the earliest of the emperors whose acts and policy
he describes For the motives of particular acts, and for the
character of particular persons (αφ, Ι. 9, 10), he is wont

was merely first among the citizens z in reality a combina-
tion of offices and powers rendered him supreme, and
converted into a farce the part which senate and people
took in the government. The proconsulare ipfflgffljum, first
bestowed on Augustus by the senate in Bo. 27, made
him absolute master of the military forces throughout
the empire. It rendered his commands binding, even over
the governors of senatorial provinces 3 it enabled him to
conclude peace and to ‹leclare war 3 to impose and collect
taxes by means of his officers. It gave him, in short, for
a period of ten years, afterwards prolonged, the power over
the entire empire which a proconsul in republican times
had wielded over his province for a single year. The
