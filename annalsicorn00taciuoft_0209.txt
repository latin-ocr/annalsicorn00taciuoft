mmained immovable and fixed, not to leave* the capital of
the empire, or to expose himself and the state to danger.
Indeed he had many conflicting 50111005 of anxiety. The
army in Germany was the stronger‚ that in Pannonia
nearer; the former relied 011 the strength of the Gauls, the
latter threatened Italy. Which should he prefer? And he
was afraid lest those whom he visited second should be
incensed by the insuit. But his sons could visit both alike
without impairing his own majesty, the dignity of which was
greater at a distance ; at the same time it was pardonable
for mere youths 'w refer some things to their father ; and

if the soldiers resisted Germanicus or Drusus, he himself
might conciliate or crush them. What resource was left,

’ if they despised their emperor? Nevertheloes, as though

on the point of departure, he chose his retinue, collected his
baggage, and equipped a fleet 3 and then, under the various
pretexts of winter and business, he cheated first sensible
men, then the populace, and longoet of all the provinces.

48. Meantime‚ Germanicus, although he had collected
his army, and had prepared vengeance for the mutineers,
‘still thought that an opportunity should be granted them,
that they might, perchance, taught by the recent warning,
consider their own safety. He, therefore, sent on a letter
to Caecina, saying that he was coming with a strong force,
and that if they did not anticipate him by executing the
guilty, he would slaughter them all alike. This letter
Caecina read in confidence to the bearers of the eagles and
standards, and all in the camp who were most free from
the taint of disaffeetion, and advised them to 1050110 1110
whole army from disgrace‚ and themselves from death.
“ For in peace,'’ he said, “a man's motives and 11050115 310
considered, but when war rages the innocent and guilty
perish alike.'' They, after sounding such persons as they
thought fit, and finding that the greater part of the legions
remained loyal, 111 accordance with the proposal of the legate,
fixed an hour at which to cut down the most degraded
and most disaffected. Then, giving the signal to one another,
they burst into the tents, and cut them down all unawares,
none save those who were in the secret knowing what was

the beginning, or what would be the end, of the slaughter.
