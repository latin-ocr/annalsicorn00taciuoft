39. Meanwhile, at the altar of the Ubii envoys from the
senate came to Germanicus, who had now returned thither.
There two legions, the first and the twentieth, and the
veterans lately discharged and kept under a standard, were
wintering. Panic-stricken and mad with the oonseiousness
of guilt, they were penetrated by fear that persons had
come by the orders of the senate, who would make void
what they had extorted by mutiny. And as it is the
custom with the mob to accuse semeone of charges, however

disclosed to them why the envoys had come 3 deplored in
eloquent terms “ the violated privileges of the embassy, the
serious and undeserved danger of Plancus, and at the same
time the disg raceful course upon whicli the legion had
entered, 'and, the assembly being confounded rather than
calmed, dismissed the envoys under the protection of some

auxiliary cavalry.
