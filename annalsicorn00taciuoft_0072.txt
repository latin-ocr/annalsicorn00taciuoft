48 memus, ANNALS 1.

the Fir-st Trium-virute in ΒΩ. 60. Crassus was killed in a Parthian

campaign Β.0. 53. Pompeius was then accepted by the senate as its

champion, and broke with Caesar, by whom he was defeated at
s Pharsalia in Β.0. 48.

Lepidi . . . Augustum: Antonius, Lepidus, and Octavius formed
the Second Trimnvimte ln B.c. 43. After the battle of Philippi in the
next year Lepidus was obliged to be content with the possession of the
province of Africa, and on attempting to oppose Octavius by means
of Sextus Pompeius‘ soldiery was deprived of all power (13.0. 36).
Antonius ruled the eastern half of the Roman domininus until he
was defeated at Actium in Β. 0. 31.

principis: princeps was a title given to Octavius at an earl yperiod
of his life. The name carried with it no official position, only imply-

ing first qs the citizens: as such it is often given to Pompeius. It is
not to be confused with the designation princeps senatus, leader of
the senate, confened on Augustus· 111 B.c. 28.

sub imperium: under military command. The imperivm, command
of the army, had been originally enjoyed by the consuls 3 then, sub-
sequently to Sulla⁷s legislation, by the proconsuls and propraetors.
But while they could only exercise it in certain provinces, Octavius
possessed it throughout the Roman territories, and was thus the head
of all the military forces of the state. It is defined by Cicero as that

‘sine quo res militaris administrari, teneri exercitus, bellum geri non
potest.' This power was latent when the consul or praetor was at
Rome3 hence the distinction between impastum domi and imperwan
‘'tziZItt'ae.

claris scriptoribus: bys illustr-iaus historiam (especially Livy and
Varro). The dative of the agent is in prose of the best period most
frequently used with the gerundive, but sometimes also with the
passive participles and adjectives in -bilw Tacitus uses it freely

<viggnizgrfssig1³spggggtpaffgggais³ to describe the times of Auqustus,
the dative of work contemplated‚ a construction in which Tacitus is

particularly fond of using the gerundjve.
donec deterrerentur: mztil they were deterred. Early writers

only make darive, like dum, govern the subj. when there is a notion
of 11uty1osse; in this case, where a simple fact is introduced, the
indicative would be used.

falsae : vweresal-rifle&

consilium mihi: sc. est, my plan is. Cp. Macaulay’s opening words:
“ Ι purpose to write,'’ etc.

et cetera: the reigns of Caligula (A.D. 37-41), Claudius (11.1).
41—54), and Nero (ΑΛ). 54-68), after which the Historiae of Tacitus
take up the narrative.

011. 2. Bruto et Cassio caesis: Brutus and Cassius, the last cham-
pions of the republic‚ w cre defeated at Philippi' in Β. c. 42 by Octavius
and Antonius. See Index. J
