sometimes the ground was withdrawn from under their
feet, and they were separated or drowned. No voice of
mutual encouragement helped them there in the face of the
waves 3 the hero was as the coward, the wise man as the
foolish; forethought was the same as chance 3 everything
was attacked by the waves with equal fury. At last
Vitellius struggled out to the higher ground, and led his
army up thither ; they passed the night without necessaries,

72. In that year triumphal honours were decreed to
A. Caecina, L. Apronius, and C. Silius for their achieve-
ments with Germanicus. The title of Father of his country,
again and again urged upon him by his people, was rejected
by Tiberius; nor did he, in spite of a vote of the senate,
