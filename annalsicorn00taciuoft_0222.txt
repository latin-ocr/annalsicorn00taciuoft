all that they held dear at home and honourable in the
camp 3 he made no mention 01 reverses. Next he handed
over, without any partiality‚ the horses of the legates and
tribunes, beginning with his own, to the bravest fighters
in the army, that these first and then the infantry might
attack the enemy.

amid hope and eagerness, and conflicting opinions from
their chiefS. Arminius advised that they should let the
Romans leave their camp, and when they had departed
surround them again in the difficult swamps. Inguiomerus
was for more spirited plans, such as barbarians exult in,
namely, to surround the rampart in arms. To'storm 13116
place would, he said, be easy 3 captives would be more
numerous, and booty unspoilt. Accordingly, at daybreak

and seized hold of the top of the rampart, the Romans
being stationed at distant intervals, and apparently para—
lyzed with fear. While they were impede'd by 13116 forti-
fications, the signal was given to the coh01·ts‚and the horns
and trumpets sounded; then with a shout and a charge they

threw themselves on 1116 rear of the Gennans, exclaim'ing ,

in defeat as they had been eager in success. Arminius
left the battle unhurt, Inguiomerus with a severe wound ;
the common soldiers were massacred as long as the Roman
rage and the light of day lasted. At length at night the
legions returned, and although more wounds and the same
want of provisions distress'ed them, they found strength,
he‘ nlth, supplies, everything in victory.
