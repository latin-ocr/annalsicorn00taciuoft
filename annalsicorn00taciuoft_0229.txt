the volume of the Tiber is increased should be diverted in
order to check its floods. Deputations from the townships
and eolonies were heard, the Florentini begging that the
Clanis should not be turned from its bed and diverted into
the river Arnus, lest this should bring ruin upon themselves.
The people of Interamna brought forward arguments similar
to these 3 the most fertile plains of Italy would, they said,
be destroyed if the river Nar, as was proposed, should be
drawn off into several streams, and overflow their banks.
Nor did the inhabitants of Reate remain silent. They
urged that the Veline lake, which discharges itself into the
Nar, should not be dammed up, as it would be sure to force

lest a larger number should enjoy power. There, are some
who suppose that his decision was as irresolute as his
perception was acute, for he did not aim at distinguished
merit, and, on the other hand, shunned vice ; he feared
danger for himself from the best men, and from the worst,
djshonour to the state 3 and in this irresolution he finally
went so far that he assigned provinces to some whom he
did not mean to allow to leave the city. ’-
